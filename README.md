# Reflect


Reflect acts as a smart mood journal. Users can write daily entries, and the app uses a trained machine learning model to detect the underlying emotion and compute a mood score. It stores the entries, tracks trends over time, and alerts users when mood consistently declines. Users can view past trends with a simple `plot` command.


## Features

- Journal entries with automatic emotion detection
- Mood scoring system ranging from -100 to +100
-  Mood trend graphing using `matplotlib` 
-  Alerts on consistent low mood with recommended resources
-  View and manage daily average mood scores
-  Beautiful CLI interface powered by `rich`
